The application "Pomodoro" permit a work time management by switching between work timer and break timer. The default work time is set to 25 minutes and the break time is set to 5 minutes. 
You can launch the timer with the "play" button and restart with the "restart" button. 
The switch between work timer and break timer is automatic. There is two indicators, "work" and "break", that shows you in wich phase you currently are.
If the timers don't suit you, you can change them win the "gear" button wich permit an access to a form where you can put your own values for the work timer and the break timer. You can put a value between 1 and 120 minutes for each. 
If the values are incorrect when you trigger the "submit" button you reach an error problem.
